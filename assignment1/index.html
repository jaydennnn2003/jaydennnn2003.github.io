              The websites main objective is to educate its audience about the
              prior views of a janitor and why their job is so important. This
              is expressed through an interactive and engaging experience. The
              website is laid out in a way that splits up information making it
              easier for the user to take in. Using different forms of
              communication the author publishes information in an entertaining
              and informative way.

              The website's fundamental goal is to publish information about a
              janitor's importance through their history. Christina Bertmans use
              of interactivity translates to people being more engaged and
              staying for more time with the website. Its creative forms of
              communication, including speech bubbles, articles and small fact
              bubbles, break down content into more digestible fragments making
              it much more inviting to the user. Its interactive user interface
              creates an easily navigable website with the desire to see what
              animations lie ahead keeping the user's attention alive.

            7. What is your impression of how the experience should be

              The different scrolling patterns that are utilized by Christina
              Bertman force the user to stay with the content for a while before
              scrolling further. An example is the transition from vertical
              scrolling to horizontal scrolling when we are presented with
              artworks. This sudden change in the scroll pattern is unexpected,
              this captures the user's attention and semi-forces them to stop
              and identify what is important enough to lead to a change in the
              scrolling pattern. We see different scrolling behaviours
              throughout the website, which is one of the reasons why the
              website retains the users engagement.

              For some users, the interactivity of the website may lead to
              frustration. To avoid this Bertman has added a navigation bar
              feature, acting as a shortcut for users, either returning or
              wishing to navigate to a certain aspect of the website promptly,
              without needing to navigate throughout the entirety of the website
              multiple times.

              As mentioned previously the website has many methods of
              communication and these are predominantly seen in the form of
              digital media. However, through digital media, there is an
              expression or what may be called an adaptation of print media or
              collage more specifically. This acts as the foundation for the
              aesthetics of the website and serves as an effective communication
              method. Combining the animated collage with the themes present
              further demonstrates the effectiveness of user engagement.

              As the site uses print media and collage styling, the website may
              be considered art by some, and being art, it creates certain
              reactions, different reactions from everyone. Because of this, it
              is hard to decipher how the user will react when viewing the
              website. What we do know is that the website attempts to be
              engaging through interactive elements and creative input. From
              this, we can assume that Bertmans work was meant to be appreciated
              not just for the information on site but for the site itself.

              The website communicates the importance and the value of
              professions with a focus on janitors. This is reflected in finding
              a sense of empathy amongst its users. Viewing how they are
              mistreated given the importance they have in keeping our world
              clean. An example of how the website expresses how janitors are
              mistreated is demonstrated by the janitors being represented as
              PNG, symbolising their invisibility in the real world.

            <p>
              The most frustrating aspect of the website experience is the
              inability to quickly navigate the website. Because the website is
              laid out in a storytelling type of way, navigating up and down the
              page has proven to be difficult and inefficient. At the top of the
              website, there is a navigation bar which does help, however, once
              the user begins scrolling down the navigation bar disappears
              leaving the only method of navigation being scrolling. Another
              slight frustration is the slow performance given the accessibility
              that some users may have. These slow loading times can test users
              frustration, especially given today's expectation of fast-paced
              responses surrounding digital media this can be frustrating.

              The most satisfying aspect of the website is its aesthetic appeal
              and animations. The interface has unique aesthetics making the
              website visually appealing. The colours, font and aesthetic style
              all contribute to creating a positive emotional response. The
              website has consistent design elements allowing users to predict
              the behaviour of the website. Through the animation and
              illustrations used we get a idea of what the themes of the website
              are without reading anything.
