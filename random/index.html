  <!-- in the body I have created an "outer" class to coverthe elements that influence the controls for the video. Then there is a section for the video container with a video link and an alt text. We then have another section 
  that controls the video controls excluding the progress bar I have done this so that the progress bar can take up the entirety of the space underneath the video rather than havin gthem next to each other.
  this gives the user a better guide as to were theyre up to in the video. -->
